How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The approach to writing a fnctional code that runs efficently starts with pseudo codes that lay the bases of how a project needs to run. The running and rernning in an attempt to make sure the code is error free isanother large part of creating effective code. Having the knowledge of the best of the corrct syntax to accomplish what we need to accomplish hand get the correct uploads and imports into thsystem
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
With this project I approached it from a break down stand point. starting with the pesdou code and peice by peice built each step in the processes adding a peice of what is needed withing the overall code.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
